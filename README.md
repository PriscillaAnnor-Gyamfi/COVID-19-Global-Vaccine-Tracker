<h1>COVID-19 Global Vaccine Tracker</h1>

<h2>Objective </h2>

<b>
The primary goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive overview of the COVID-19 vaccination progress worldwide, focusing on the population's vaccination status, including partially vaccinated, fully vaccinated, and unvaccinated individuals. Additionally, the project aims to analyze the proportion of the population that is fully vaccinated and assess its impact on the GDP per capita of countries.</b>


<h2>Key Metrics and Visualizations </h2>
Below are the key metrics I considered in the design of this dashboard:
- <b>Population Vaccination Status: I visualized the calculated number of individuals who are partially vaccinated, fully vaccinated, and not vaccinated at all, aggregated at the country level.</b>
- <b>Proportion of Population Fully Vaccinated: I displayed the calculated percentage of the population that has completed the full vaccination regimen in each country.</b>
- <b>Trend Analysis: The progress of vaccination rates was tracked over time, starting from the project's specified start date (9/4/2020) to the end date (7/2/2022), using interactive line charts or time series plots.</b>
- <b>GDP Per Capita Comparison: I compared the GDP per capita of countries with their vaccination rates to analyze any correlation or impact of vaccination on economic indicators.</b>
- <b>Geographic Mapping: I visualized the vaccination coverage geographically using maps to depict regional disparities and trends.</b>


<h2>Dashboard Features </h2>

- <b>Interactive Filters: Allows users to filter data based on parameters such as date range, geographical country and continent.</b>
- <b>Drill-Down Functionality: Enables users to explore detailed information by clicking on specific countries or continent to view vaccination metrics and associated GDP per capita.</b>
- <b>Dynamic Data Updates: Implements automated data fetching and updating mechanisms to ensure that the dashboard reflects the most recent vaccination and GDP data.</b>
- <b>User-Friendly Interface: An intuitive and visually appealing dashboard layout with clear navigation and informative tooltips to enhance user experience.
