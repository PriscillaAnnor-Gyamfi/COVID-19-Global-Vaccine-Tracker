<h1>COVID-19 Global Vaccine Tracker</h1>

<h2>Objective </h2>

<b>
The primary goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive overview of the COVID-19 vaccination progress worldwide, focusing on the population's vaccination status, including partially vaccinated, fully vaccinated, and unvaccinated individuals. Additionally, the project aims to analyze the proportion of the population that is fully vaccinated and assess its impact on the GDP per capita of countries.</b>


<h2>Key Metrics and Visualizations </h2>

<b>
Population Vaccination Status: Visualize the number of individuals who are partially vaccinated, fully vaccinated, and not vaccinated at all, aggregated at the country level.
Proportion of Population Fully Vaccinated: Calculate and display the percentage of the population that has completed the full vaccination regimen in each country.
Trend Analysis: Track the progress of vaccination rates over time, starting from the project's specified start date (9/4/2020) to the end date (7/2/2022), using interactive line charts or time series plots.
GDP Per Capita Comparison: Compare the GDP per capita of countries with their vaccination rates to analyze any correlation or impact of vaccination on economic indicators.
Geographic Mapping: Visualize the vaccination coverage geographically using choropleth maps to depict regional disparities and trends.</b>
